            <h4>The Design of Waste</h4>
            <p> 
            "The invention of new technology is the invention of an accident. Train and Train Wreck. Waste can be understood as accidents, every time there is a deliberate production there is an accidental production what we call waste." Paul Virilio
            Although waste seems to be a by-product of contemporary society, its effects seem to be far surpassing the effects of the system that has created it. It is the waste of the contemporary society that is contributing to the sixth mass extinction event, a system that produces the byproduct of waste. Waste is, above all, a designation. It’s time to design waste.
            "waste is no more than a theoretical concept in a hyper-capitalist system. there is no real separation between the technological devices and the human body. the matter is in a state of constant flux".
            Waste is a design product of contemporary society, that has locked humanity in the direction of self-destruction. The social construct of waste has an enormous impact on the earth. The impact of so-called waste is truly a planetary scale. The Carbon in the atmosphere is at its highest for the last 800 000 years. The area of all landfills in Russia is the size of the Netherlands. 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic are in the landfills and will eventually make it to the water streams. ( Link ) Waste is nothing short of uncontrolled, roger, planetary geoengineering projects

            <h4>Deep Time</h4>
            <p>
            “In some sense, waste is physically embodied information. Much of what we know about the past, we know from things thrown away, the discarded objects that record human activity and the passage of time” — ‘Waste as Information’
            Uncontrolled waste is not a uniquely human condition. Deep-time geological history is riddled with unmetabolised waste. 
            "Over geological history, the biosphere has also failed to recycle its own wastes, with catastrophic consequences for many species. In the time leading up to the Great Oxidation Event about 2.4 billion years ago". (e.g. Lenton & Watson 2011)
            During the great oxidation event, a Paleoproterozoic Cyanobacteria produced oxygen in such access that rendered the atmosphere unlivable for the very organisms that have produced it. As tragic this event has been for the cyanobacteria that caused it, the oxidation event enabled the subsequent development of multicellular life forms and the atmospheric oxygen that we breathe. Waste has always been a terraforming tool.
            We imagine that human civilization is much more advanced than the Paleoproterozoic Cyanobacteria, but the most recent ICCP Report report, the accumulation of plastic in the oceans, the vast amounts of landfills proves contrary. Human civilization so far has not been able to control its waste products any better than the single-cell organisms.

            <h4>Waste and Externality</h4>
            <p>
            Let's come back out time and timescales and understand how waste is designed now. What are the building blocks of it, who are the designers and how does waste operate ?
            Contemporary waste is pushed to the fringes, with no function, plan, and imagined utility for it. Waste is never in the center, its send far to the invisible places for the invisible people to deal with by invisible economic systems.
            This externalization is done through a set of geographical imaginaries, Economic Structures, and ideological notions. social, economic, and spatial externalities of waste are peripheral yet perpetual -in Russia, across lands and seas, and in outer space. Large scale sites of obsolescence or the places and spaces devoid of desire and value are in fact loaded with interconnected and overlapping histories.
            </p>

            <h4>Unwaste</h4>
            <p> 
            Unwaste is a world of common futures that, a collection of multimedia science fiction speculations on large-scale sites of obsolescence in the Russian Territory, delicately blurring fact with fiction. Each story acts as a database of live links to further research on the historic and contemporary facts of the sites.
